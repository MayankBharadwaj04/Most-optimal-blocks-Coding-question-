Solution Approach :â€” 
There are multiple possible answers to that question, where we can basically establish a choose among space and time complexities.

We will first stores the farthest distance of a particular service for every block. Now for every block, we will go through every requirement and find the closest 
block that satisfies that requirements and change value for that block with a minimum of the current value and maximum distance for any requirement. 
At the end we will return the index of the minimum value.
